#Steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within non-suspicious files like images, audio, video, or text.
#Unlike encryption, which scrambles data, steganography conceals the existence of the hidden message.
#Image steganography embeds data into image pixels by slightly altering their color values.
#LSB (Least Significant Bit) technique is a common method that modifies the last bit of pixel values.
#Audio steganography hides data within sound waves using phase coding or spread spectrum techniques.
#Video steganography embeds data within video frames without noticeable changes.
#Text steganography uses white spaces, font variations, or invisible characters to hide messages.
#Steganalysis is the process of detecting hidden data using statistical and pattern analysis techniques.
#Applications include secure communication, watermarking, copyright protection, and digital forensics.
#Modern steganography tools include OpenStego, Steghide, and SilentEye for embedding and extracting hidden data.
